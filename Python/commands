To move or copy text, you can combine the following commands

p  - put
	then put the deleted text where you desire (cut & paste)
y  - copy text (then "p" for put)
cw  - change everything to the end of the word.
c2b - change everything to the last two words before the cursor's position.
c$  - change everything to the end of the line.
	Also the same as "C".
c0  - change everything to the beginning of the line.
	c (Like i and a leaves you in insert mode until you press the ESC key)
cc  - change everything on the current line of the editor.
r  - make a change to one character.
	VIM only allows for one character change using this command. Simply call r, VIM enters INSERT mode, insert one character change, finally VIM exits back to command mode.
