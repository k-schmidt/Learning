# Learning

Repository of my experiments as I discover new languages.

## Table of Contents:

[4Clojure](./4Clojure)
* 4Clojure problems that I am solving using Clojure. 4Clojure is a website located [here](http://www.4clojure.com/).
  * Sorry, you cannot look for foreclosed houses at this site.

[CPP](./CPP)
* Brief stint with C++.

[C Programming](./C_Programming)
* Another brief stint. I wasn't ready for this language yet.

[Clojure](./Clojure)
* Various tests in the Clojure language.

[DOT](./DOT)
* An **awesome** visualization language, CHECK IT OUT!

[Data Structures and Algorithms](./Data_Structures_and_Algorithms)
* Python book I am using to learn data structures and algorithms

[Haskell](./Haskell)
* Loved Haskell, but I love Clojure more. (Dynamic languages ++, developing in a REPL +++)

[LaTex](./LaTex)
* LaTex documents

[Machine Learning Exercises](./Machine_Learning_Exercises)
* Python book I am using to learn machine learning.

[Project Euler](./Project_Euler)
* Project Euler problems in various languages
  * [Python](./Project_Euler/Python)
  * [Clojure](./Project_Euler/Clojure)

[Python](./Python)
* Catch-all directory for learning Python
